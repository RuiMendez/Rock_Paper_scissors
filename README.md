The first part of the project consisted in creating a console based game using the prompt as an input

Things I've learned:

    • Deepened my knowledge about functions and the different ways I can use them to solve problems
    • It helped me to finally understand the while loop and its practicality
    • It taught me how to tackle a project

The second part of the project consisted in creating an user interface using CSS.
My big aha moment with this part of the project was to find out you can use array methods on element nodes.
It was also pretty cool to play around with CSS hover effects and explore the possibilities.

This was my first project where I had to create an interactive user interface, it was very challenging but very rewarding in the end.
